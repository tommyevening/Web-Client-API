# 🌦️ Web-Client API

## 🎯 About the Project
The **Web-Client API** is a desktop application written in **Java** that showcases my skills in:
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Integration with external APIs
- Designing modern graphical user interfaces
- Handling real-time data

The application uses **JavaFX** to create a responsive and visually appealing GUI while integrating with **Weather API** and **Currency API** to fetch real-time weather data and exchange rates. Additionally, the **Gson** library is utilized for seamless JSON data processing.

## 🌟 Project Scope

### 🌐 Weather API Integration
- Fetching real-time weather data: **temperature, humidity, pressure, atmospheric conditions**.
- Handling different locations based on user input.

### 🎨 Modern Graphical Interface (JavaFX)
- **Responsive and visually appealing GUI**
- User interactions such as selecting a location and refreshing data.

### 💱 Multi-Currency Support (Currency API)
- Retrieving real-time exchange rates and performing currency conversions.
- Seamless integration with an external API for dynamic data updates.

### 📦 JSON Data Processing (Gson)
- **Automatically mapping JSON data to Java objects**.
- Simplified data handling with clean and efficient code.

### 🏗️ Modular Code Architecture
- **Separating business logic from the presentation layer**.
- Ensuring ease of maintenance and expandability.
